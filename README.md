# e-Commerce-Project
This is an business project I did in collaboration with another two group mates - Ted Fergusson and Joseph Demarchi. 

This project satisfied the following criterias:

- Create a business idea that falls within the sweet spot of eCommerce. 
- Generate a home page for your business. This page should look clean and professional. 
- This page should also include a link or button to the ‘About Us’ Page. This is a page where you can describe your business in full (what you do, what benefits you provide, how you might help people, what values your company might stand for). This page should include a ‘Purchase’ or ‘Sign Up Now’ button, but this button does not have to do anything yet. 
- Create a logo, slogan, or some unique identifier for your business. 
- Create an additional page within your web application which includes a form that will allow users (customers) to enter their information. 
- Within myPhpAdmin, create an appropriately named table (i.e. siteUsers, currentCustomers), table that includes attributes that will be used to store your customer information. 
- Create a ‘Sign Up’ button at the bottom of your form that when clicked, calls some routine or program that will be used to insert the data in the form into your database table. 
- Connect to your myPhpAdmin database using server side code (highly suggested to use PHP) to access the information that is sent to the server. 
- Pass data inside the form fields on your web application page to your server side processing code, passing the data as POST variables.
- Insert the data passed by the user to the server into your database table that you created within myPhpAdmin. This will involve constructing an insertion query which you will use to query and operate on the database. 
- Update your previous pages’ navigation bar to account for the addition of the new ‘Sign Up’ page. Any page within your application should be accessible from any other page. The Sign Up page should have an identical navigation bar as your first two pages. 
- Alter the form that you created on your signup page to allow for the incorporation of credit card information (type, number, expiration date, and CCV number)
- Implement Stripe (in test mode) to allow you to create a new customer in Stripe and charge them some fake amount. These transactions should be viewable on your Stripe dashboard if completed successfully.
- Implement front-end form validation for all fields in the form on your Sign Up page.
- Improve your server code that is used to process a user and write to your database to incorporate email functionality. 
- Make sure that your site is generally well polished, and that it looks and functions like a cohesive web application.
